# Marvel-Ultimate-War



I worked in a team of two to build a 2-player battle game. Each player picks 3 champions to form his team and fight. The
players take turns to fight the other player’s champions. The turns will keep going back and forth until a player is able to
defeat all of the other player’s champions.
