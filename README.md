# Marvel-Ultimate-War


Achieved a deeper knowledge of software architecture by applying Object-Oriented Programming principles while
collaborating within a team of two to build a 2-player battle game using Java.\
In this game, each player picks three champions to form a team and fight.
During the battle, each player will use his champions to attack the opponent champions either by using normal attacks or using special attacks/abilities.\
The battle takes place on a 5x5 grid. Each cell in the grid can either be empty, or contain a champion or obstacle/cover. At the beginning of the battle, each team will stand at one of the sides/edges of the grid as a starting position.
